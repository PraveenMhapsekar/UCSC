Evaluate the validity of the scopes in the following expression implementing stacks.
Ignore the operators and operand in the expression while checking the validity of the expression.

Input Expression:
{x + (y – [a + b] ) * (c – [ (d + e) ]  + k )} / (h – (j – (k – [l – n] ) ) ) + { u +  [m  * (p  – q)] / r }

Print each scope or symbol encountered while scanning the expression and what resulting action taken for each 
symbol input. Read all symbols from an input file and write the result to an output file.
